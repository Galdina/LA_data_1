**What is unique about LA County’s data?**

It is clipped to the ocean boundary. Raw Census data includes a 3 mile buffer into the ocean, which impacts cartography.

IMPORTANT! It has been updated to the 2012 Census Geography Update, which merged Tracts 1370.00 and 9304.01 into the combined tract 1370.00. So the CT10 field actually reflects the 2012 Census update, which is used for all population products 2012 and later.

How was this data created?

This data was downloaded from Census Bureau website: http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2010/file-download and clipped to the County Boundary using ESRI’s ArcGIS Desktop. Two new fields were added in census tract data – area in square feet and shape length in feet. This dataset has unique identifier field “GEOID10” for each record and the census tract number fields “CT10” and “LABEL” (6-digit number and 6-digit number with decimal point, respectively).
